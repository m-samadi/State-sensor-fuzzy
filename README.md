# State of the sensor nodes using fuzzy logic
This repository includes the simulation process of the paper entitled "Determining the State of the Sensor Nodes Based on Fuzzy Theory in WSNse" published by IJCCC in August 2014.
<br/>
<br/>
## Elements
The repository contains three methods: AllActive, RAS and FAS.
<br/>
<br/>
AllActive is the simulation process of the All Active method, RAS is the simulation of the Random Active Sleep method, and FAS is the simulation of the Fuzzy Active Sleep method.
<br/>
<br/>
## Programming language
The programs are developed in MATLAB.
